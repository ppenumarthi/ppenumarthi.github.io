</p><h4>15-105 ACADEMIC INTEGRITY POLICY - SPRING 2009</h4>

It is expected that you will complete each assignment on your own, and 
each answer you submit represents your own work and not someone else's 
work, in full or in part. In other words, do your own work.
<p>

You can talk about the assignments with your peers or a CA in order to 
understand what a problem is asking, but when you develop your solution, 
it should be YOURS. If you are having trouble coming up with a correct 
answer, your own answer, even if it is incorrect, is much better than 
someone else's that you don't understand. In this way, we can identify 
areas where you are having trouble, and we can give you help to understand 
these harder concepts.
</p><p>
 
If you are having trouble keeping up with the workload due to personal 
issues, your best action is to see your instructor rather than copy 
someone else's work. Your instructor can help you work toward a solution 
and will be very happy to assist.
</p><p>

During exams, your work must be your own with no communication between you 
and others (except course staff) during the exams, and you may not use any 
unauthorized materials during the exam.
</p><p>
 
Students who violate this policy will be charged with academic dishonesty 
that can result in failure in this course and possible expulsion from 
Carnegie Mellon University. Review the official University Code for more 
information.

</p><p> 
By signing below, I have read the statements above and have reviewed the 
University's policy for cheating and plagiarism, and I will abide by these 
policies in this course.
