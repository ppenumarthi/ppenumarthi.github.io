<p>
<b>WRITTEN PROBLEMS (8 pts)</b>
</p><p>
<i>Hand these problems in on paper in class on the due date specified.</i>
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li>(1 pt) For the following graph, show how to store this graph using an 
adjacency matrix and an adjacent list.
<p>

</p><p>
</p></li><li>
(1 pt) The graph above represents islands of an island nation, and each 
edge represents an individual ferry that shuttle passengers between 
a pair 
of islands. The costs on the edges represent the cost to operate each
ferry in millions of dollars. The government wants to reduce ferry service
due to
high fuel costs, so they want to eliminate ferries that are not needed.
Use the minimal spanning tree algorithm shown in class to solve this problem. 
List the island-to-island connections that you want to 
keep, in 
the order you select them, and give the minimum total cost of the ferries 
needed (in millions of dollars)
so that all islands remain connected to each other.
<p>
</p></li><li>
(1 1/2 pts) The form for a floating point number in a programming language 
could be 
defined by the EBNF rules below. Note that the period (<tt>.</tt>) , the 
digits <tt>0</tt> through <tt>9</tt> and the letter <tt>E</tt> are literals. 
<p>
digit &#8592; <tt>0</tt> | <tt>1</tt> | <tt>2</tt> | <tt>3</tt> | <tt>4</tt> | 
<tt>5</tt> | <tt>6</tt> | <tt>7</tt> | <tt>8</tt> | <tt>9</tt>
<br>
base &#8592; digit { digit } <tt>.</tt> digit { digit }
<br>
exponent &#8592; <tt>E</tt> digit digit
<br>
float_number &#8592; base [ exponent ]
</p><p>
(a) Show that the following strings are valid floating point numbers by 
deriving them from the float_number rule above.
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li><tt>43.814E12</tt>
</li><li><tt>352.1</tt>
</li></ul>
<p>
(b) Draw a syntax diagram for each of the EBNF rules above.
</p><p>
(c) For each of the following strings, explain why they are not valid floating 
point numbers according to the EBNF rules above.
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li><tt>2.6E9</tt>
</li><li><tt>.183</tt>
</li></ul>
<p>

</p></li><li>(1 pt) <p>
(a) A central processing unit (CPU) of a computer only executes instructions 
written in what language?
</p><p> 
(b) What is the purpose of a compiler?
</p><p>
(c) High-level programs can be translated for the CPU to execute only if they 
do not contain what kind of errors?
</p><p>
(d) What is the difference between an interpreter and a compiler?
</p><p>

</p></li><li>(1 pt) 
Consider the following Pascal program. You may assume n &gt; 0. 
<p>
</p><pre>program mystery(input,output); 
var i, sum, n: integer; 
begin 
   read(n); 
   i := 1; 
   sum := 0; 
   repeat 
      sum := sum + i; 
      i := i * 2; 
   until i = n; 
   writeln(sum + 1); 
end. 
</pre>
<p>
(a) What does the 2nd line in the Pascal program specify? How does this differ 
from Python?
</p><p>
(b) Draw a flowchart for the loop in the program above. 
</p><p>
(c) What computation is the program performing with respect to n? 
</p><p>
</p></li><li>(1 1/2 pts)<p>
Consider the following Scheme definitions for cars that include the make, 
mileage, color and fuel efficiency (mpg), respectively: 
</p><p>
</p><pre>(define mustang (list 'Ford 4328 'red 26))
(define sonata (list 'Hyundai 54326 'black 30)) 
(define traverse (list 'Chevrolet 3820 'white 24)) 
(define civic (list 'Honda 72019 'silver 36)) 
(define prius (list 'Toyota 2144 'green 48))
</pre>
<p>
(a) What is the value of <tt>(first traverse)</tt>? What is the value of 
<tt>(rest prius)</tt>? 
</p><p>
(b) Complete the following Scheme definition: 
</p><p>
</p><pre>(define (color car) 
     (________________________________)) 
</pre>
<p>
(c) Using the following Scheme function definition:
</p><p>
</p><pre>(define (compute car1 car2 car3) 
     (+ (first (rest car1)) (first (rest car2)) (first (rest car3)) ) )
</pre>
What does the following Scheme function return as its result?
<p>
</p><pre>(compute sonata civic mustang)</pre> 
<p>
Show your work by performing a series of substitutions to show how 
Scheme evaluates the function. 
</p><p>

</p></li><li>(1 pt)
Here is a set of Prolog rules. 
<p>
</p><pre>parent(homer, bart).   
parent(homer, lisa).   
parent(homer, maggie).   
parent(marge, bart).   
parent(marge, lisa).   
parent(marge, maggie).   
parent(abe, homer).    
parent(jacqueline, marge).  
parent(jacqueline, patty).  
parent(jacqueline, selma). 
male(bart).   
male(homer). 
male(abe). 
female(marge). 
female(lisa). 
female(maggie). 
female(jacqueline). 
female(patty). 
female(selma). 
father(X,Y) :- parent(X,Y), male(X). 
mother(X,Y) :- parent(X,Y), female(X). 
grandparent(X,Y) :- parent(X,Z), parent(Z,Y).
</pre>
<p>
What is each of the following Prolog queries asking (in English)? What are the 
results of each query based on the rules above?
</p><p>
</p><pre>?- female(homer).

?- parent(X, marge).

?- grandparent(abe, Y).

?- father(X, Y).
</pre>
</li></ol>

<h3>COMPUTER PROBLEM (2 pts)</h3>
<p>
<i>Hand this in electronically using the 
<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tcortina/15-105sp09/handin.html">Electronic Handin System</a> by 11:59PM on the due 
date indicated.
</i>
</p><p> 
Write a short Python program that processes an array of data and reverses the 
order of the data. For example, if your original array is [3,1,6,4,8], then 
your program should output [8,4,6,1,3]. Don't just print each element 
starting from the last element, working backwards. You should <i>change</i> 
the array so it really is reversed before you print it (see the algorithm 
below).  Your program should work for any size array.
</p><p>
Basic Algorithm:
</p><p>
</p><pre>1. Create an array A with integers in it.
2. Set i = 0
3. Set n = (length of the array A)
4. Exchange A[i] with A[n-1-i]
5. Add 1 to i
6. Go to step 4 and repeat until the array is reversed
