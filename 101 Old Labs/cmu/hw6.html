<b>WRITTEN PROBLEMS (8 pts)</b>
</p><p>
<i>Hand these problems in on paper in class on the due date specified.</i>
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li>(1.5 pts) 
A DNA sequence consists of only the letters A, C, T and G. Suppose we 
examine many sequences and find the relatively frequencies (in 
percentages) for each letter: 
<p>
</p><pre>LETTER    FREQUENCY 
  T          63 
  A          20 
  G          10 
  C           7 
</pre>
<p> 
</p><ol type="a">
<li>
Derive a Huffman tree for this 4-letter alphabet, and assign a binary 
Huffman code for each letter based on your tree. 
<p>
</p></li><li>
Using your Huffman codes from part (a), how many bits would be 
required to encode the DNA sequence ATTGCTATTTAGTT? Show your work. 
<p>
</p></li><li> 
Assign a binary code for each letter using the smallest fixed-width 
code possible. How many bits would be required to encode the DNA sequence 
in part (b) now? Show your work. 
</li></ol>
<p>

</p></li><li>
(2 pts) Consider the graph shown below:

</p><ol type="a">
<li>
Trace the shortest path algorithm given in class, showing the values in 
the SP and Pr tables as illustrated in lecture. What is the length of the 
shortest path from node A to node F? 
<p>
</p></li><li> 
If we used a greedy algorithm to find the shortest path from node A to 
node F, starting with node A, what path would we pick? What is its total 
length? Does the greedy algorithm find the shortest path as you found in 
part (a)? Why or why not? 
</li></ol>

(1 pt)
Some software bugs are related to representations of time in a computer. 
In the late 1990s, software developers had to contend with the Y2K 
bug.  A time-related software bug occurred in 2007 and was a big 
news story. Describe what this bug was and how it affected computer 
operations. (HINT: It is related to an annual event that happens on 
Sunday, March 8 of this year.)
<p>

</p></li><li>
(2 pts)
When software is tested for correctness, one technique is to come up with 
a set of data values that cause every path in a program to be executed at 
least once. For the flowchart 
below, there are 8 unique paths through the flowchart. For each unique 
path, give values 
for x, y and z that will cause that unique path through the flowchart to 
be executed. For each unique path, also give the final value of a.

(1.5 pts)
We claim that the following algorithm computes M<sup>N</sup>, where M and 
N are positive integers.
<p>
</p><pre>1. Set answer equal to M. 
2. Set i equal to 1. 
3. While i &#8800; N do the following: 
   (a) Multiply answer by M. 
   (b) Add 1 to i. 
4. Output answer.
</pre>
<p>
The invariant for this loop is <tt><b>answer = M<sup>i</sup></b></tt>. You 
will use this invariant to show logically that this algorithm is correct.
</p><p>
</p><ol type="a">
<li>Show that the invariant is true immediately before the loop begins.
<p>
</p></li><li>
Assume that the invariant is true at the start of each iteration of the 
loop. We want to show that the invariant is also true at the end of each 
iteration of the loop.
<p>
</p><ol type="i">
<li>After step 3a, what is <tt>answer</tt> equal to? 
<p>
</p></li><li>After step 3b, what is <tt>answer</tt> equal to? 
</li></ol>
<p>
</p></li><li>Show that after the loop terminates, the output answer <u>must</u> be 
M<sup>N</sup>.
<p>
</p></li><li>Give a brief argument that explains why the loop must terminate.
<p>

<h3>COMPUTER PROBLEM (2 pts)</h3>
<p>
<i>Hand this in electronically using the 
<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tcortina/15-105sp09/handin.html">Electronic Handin System</a> by 11:59PM on the due 
date indicated.

The number of ways to choose r items from n unique items, 1 &#8804; r &#8804; n, 
is given by the recursive formula:
</p><p>
C(n,r) = C(n-1, r-1) + C(n-1, r), when 1 &lt; r &lt; n.<br>
C(n,r) = n , when r = 1.<br>
C(n,r) = 1 , when r = n.
</p><p>
For example, the number of ways to choose 2 letters from the 4 letters 
ABCD is 6: AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD. The formula gives us this numerical 
answer recursively:
</p><p>
</p><pre>C(4,2) = C(3,1) + C(3,2) 
       =    3   + C(3,2) 
       =    3   + C(2,1) + C(2,2) 
       =    3   +    2   + C(2,2)
       =    3   +    2   +    1 
       =    6
</pre>
<p>
Write a Python program that has a main function that asks the user for the 
number of items (n) and the number of items chosen (r) and then outputs 
the number of ways of choosing r items out of n items.  The main function 
should call a recursive function that computes and returns the answer.  
The recursive function should have two parameters: the values for n and r.
