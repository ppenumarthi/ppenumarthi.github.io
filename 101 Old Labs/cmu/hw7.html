<p>
<b>WRITTEN PROBLEMS (8 pts)</b>
</p><p>
<i>Hand these problems in on paper in class on the due date specified.</i>
</p><p>
</p><ol>

<li>(1.5 pts)
You write the following statement in Python, where x is an integer greater 
than 0:
<p>
</p><pre>y = (x**3 + 2*x) / 3
</pre>
Remember in Python that when you divide one integer by another, you may 
get a truncation error since you lose 
the fractional part of the result. For example, 11/3 in Python is 3, not 
3.6666666.... You are concerned that you might
get a truncation error when it is stored in y,
but someone tells you that x<sup>3</sup> + 2x is always
evenly divisible by 3 when x is positive, so there is never any truncation 
error.  You will use induction to verify this.
<p>
</p><ol type="a">
<li>
Show that the Python statement has no truncation error for x = 1. 
<p>
</p></li><li>
Assume the statement has no truncation error for some integer x &#8805; 1.
Show that the statement has no truncation error for x+1. Put another way,
assuming x<sup>3</sup> + 2x is evenly divisible by 3 for an integer x &#8805; 
1, show that (x+1)<sup>3</sup> + 2(x+1) is also evenly divisible by 3.
<p>
HINT: Expand (x+1)<sup>3</sup> + 2(x+1) algebraically, extract out 
x<sup>3</sup> + 2x, and look at what is left.
</p><p>
</p></li><li>
How do steps (a) and (b) prove that the Python statement computes 
correctly without truncation error for all integer x &#8805; 1?
</li></ol>
<p>

</p></li><li>(1.5 pts)
Let A be a vector of N integers in increasing order, N &gt; 0. There are no 
duplicates. Consider the following algorithm for binary search (div means 
integer division - i.e. discard the fractional remainder when you divide).
This algorithm outputs the index of the target if it is in the array and
-1 if it is not.
<p>
</p><pre>1. Set low = 0. 
2. Set high = N-1. 
3. Set mid = (low + high) div 2. 
4. While low &#8804; high and target &#8800; A[mid] do the following: 
   a. If target &lt; A[mid], set high = mid-1; otherwise, set low = mid+1. 
   b. Set mid = (low + high) div 2.
5. If low &#8804; high, output mid.
   Otherwise, output -1.
</pre>
<p>
</p><ol type="a">
<li>
Trace this algorithm for the following vector (N=9) and a target value of 
73, showing the value of low, high, and mid immediately before the loop 
starts and after each iteration of the loop. What is the final value that 
is output?
<p>
</p><pre>   0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9   10
 ------------------------------------------------------
| 13 | 29 | 33 | 40 | 58 | 64 | 68 | 73 | 89 | 92 | 99 |
 ------------------------------------------------------
</pre>
<p>
</p></li><li>
Repeat part (a) for a target value of 36.
<p>
</p></li><li>
If you had 1 billion data values in increasing order and you had to 
search for a specific target using binary search, approxmiately how many 
data values do you need to look at in order to determine if the target is 
present or not? Explain your answer.  
</li></ol>
<p>
</p></li><li>(1.5 pts)
You have three algorithms to solve a problem. The problem involves 
examining N objects for defects.  Each examination of an object takes 1 
minute.
<p>  
</p><ol type="a">
<li>How long would it take to examine 4 objects (i.e. N=4) if your 
algorithm requires the following number of steps:
<p>
</p><ol type="i">
<li>Algorithm 1: log<sub>2</sub>N steps
</li><li>Algorithm 2: N<sup>2</sup> steps
</li><li>Algorithm 3: 2<sup>N</sup> steps
</li></ol>
<p>
</p></li><li>How many <i>more</i> minutes would be needed to use the same 
algorithms above 
if you examined four times as many objects (i.e. N=16)?
<p>
</p></li><li>Which of the three algorithms would you use on a warehouse of 1 
million objects? Explain.
</li></ol>
<p>
</p></li><li>(1.5 pts)
In an American Idol competition, there are 10 contestants. Each 
constestant sings one song, and then one contestant is eliminated. The 
remaining contestants sing one song each, and then one contestant is 
eliminated again. This continues until one contestant remains and is 
declared the winner.  The winner sings one song at the end of the
competition.
<p>
</p><ol type="a">
<li>How many songs are sung in this competition if it starts with 10 
contestants? Show your work.
<p>
</p></li><li>If there were N contestants in this competition, N &gt; 0, exactly how 
many songs are sung in this competition as a function of N?
<p>
</p></li><li>Answer part (b) using Big O notation in simplest form.
Explain what your big O notation says about this problem.
</li></ol>

A museum has 12 square canvases. Each has two diagonal  
lines separating the canvas into four triangular regions. Each  
region is painted with a solid color.
<p>
The museum wants to display the canvases in a 4 X 3 grid so that 
triangular regions of 
two canvases that are touching have the same color.  Here are examples 
with 2 canvases only:
</p><p>
<img src="./hw7_files/hw7tiles.jpg">
</p><p>
</p><ol type="a">
<li>
Assuming the museum does not rotate the canvases, how many different 
configurations have to be checked in the worst case to see if there is a 
possible way to display the artwork? Explain your answer. 
<p>
</p></li><li>
If the museum takes 1 minute to set up one 4 X 3 configuration, how 
long would it take to check all possible configurations to see if one 
meets their display criteria? Express your answer in years. 
</li></ol>
<p>
</p></li><li>
You are asked to create a map of South America for a company brochure but 
you are asked to use only 3 colors to fill in all of the countries. South 
America consists of 13 countries. See the map below.
<p>
<img src="./hw7_files/SouthAmerica.png">
</p><p>
</p><ol type="a">
<li>
Determine if there is a valid coloring for this map using the colors 
red, green and yellow. If there is, give the color for each country. If 
not, explain why.
<p>
</p></li><li>
In general, for a map with 13 countries, if each country can be 
colored with one of three colors, how many possible color 
assignments are there? NOTE: We're not asking for how many valid 
assignments there are, only how many total assignments there are.

<h3>COMPUTER PROBLEM (2 pts)</h3>
<p>
<i>Hand this in electronically using the 
<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tcortina/15-105sp09/handin.html">Electronic Handin System</a> by 11:59PM on the due 
date indicated.

</p><p> 
The average high temperature for Pittsburgh in Fahrenheit
is given by the following data:
</p><p>
</p><pre>January   36
February  39
March     50
April     61
May       71
June      79
July      83
August    81
September 74
October   63
November  51
December  40
</pre>
<p>
Write a Python program that stores these temperature values in an array. 
You do not 
need to read these values from the keyboard. You can just set up an array 
with these temperature values directly. Then 
create a window that is 200 pixels wide by 300 pixels high. In this 
window, draw a bar graph that shows these temperatures from January
at the top to December at the bottom. The left edge of the window 
represents 0<sup>o</sup> and the right edge of the window represents 
100<sup>o</sup>. 
Each bar should be 25 pixels high. 
The width of each bar depends on the temperature for each month.
The colors of the bars should alternate between green
and yellow. Each bar should include text that displays the temperature
for that month, centered along the bar.
</p><p>
Helpful programming hints:
You should write this program using a loop that repeats 12 times
so you don't have to write the same general
code 12 times.  
To alternate 
colors, check the value of your loop variable: use green for even, use 
yellow for odd. Here is what the final output should look like:
</p><p>

</p><p>
NOTE: Your final program should work for any temperature data (between 10 
and 100), not just Pittsburgh's temperatures.
