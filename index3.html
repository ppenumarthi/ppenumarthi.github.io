<h2>Grading</h2>
</section>
	
<section id="attendance"><h2>Policy on attendance</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Attendance in <b>LAB</b> is <b>REQUIRED</b>!</li>
	<li>As per USC policy, "Absence from more than 10 percent of the scheduled class sessions, whether
	excused or unexcused, is excessive and the instructor may choose to exact a grade penalty for such 
	absences." (<a href="http://www.sc.edu/bulletin/ugrad/acadregs.html">http://www.sc.edu/bulletin/ugrad/acadregs.html</a>)</li>
	<li>Attendance in labs is required. You cannot sign the attendance sheet and leave before class time is over. 
	If you do, you will be marked absent. Signing the attendance sheet and leaving early and/or signing 
	someone else's name are both violations of the honor code.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section id="labWork"><h2>Policy for lab work</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Late lab work is accepted up to TWO weekdays after the posted due date and time. Late assignments will 
	receive a 15% grade penalty.</li>
	<li>Using the lab when another class is in session is prohibited. You may use the lab ONLY during your 
	scheduled lab time and during open lab hours (posted on lab doors, and on the class webpage.) A lab 
	monitor may be available to answer questions.</li>
	<li>If you experience problems completing a lab assignment, seek help! Every instructor in
	Sumwalt 340 can (and will) help if you ask. Don't be shy.</li>
	<li>Lab assignments are to be saved in the designated "101Summer" folder on the X: before the deadline.</li>
	<li>Instructors have READ ONLY permission for information on your X: and cannot edit any of your files.</li>
	<li>Only assignments saved on the X: will be graded.</li>
	<li>You must pass the lab in order to pass the course. You cannot pass the course if you fail the lab, no matter 
	what your grade is for everything else.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section id="howTo">
<h2>How to do well in this course</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Attend lectures and labs. Much of the material that you will be expected to know is not directly from the 
	textbook. Topics in the textbook will be supplemented with information from other sources.</li>
	<li>Complete homework assignments. Quiz and test questions will be similar to or identical to homework 
	problems.</li>
	<li>Seek help if needed. If you don't understand something taught in class or assigned, see me after class, or 
	during my office hours. Don't wait until you have several chapters of material that you don't understand 
	before coming to see me.</li>
	<li>Read the academic responsibility and "what every student should know" document. It can be found here:
		<a href="http://www.cse.sc.edu/%7Ecmatthew/acad_response.htm">http://www.cse.sc.edu/~cmatthew/acad_response.htm</a>

<section id="cheating">
<h2>Policy for Cheating</h2>
	<p> The University of South Carolina and the Department of Computer 
Science and Engineering take a strong stand against cheating. 
	Anyone caught cheating in this course will receive a grade of F and the
 incident will be reported, which may result in further disciplinary 
	action.&nbsp; You are allowed to ask for help in the labs and on 
certain parts of projects and homework; but do your own work. 
	Don't let anyone do it for you. Do not turn in someone else's work as 
your own or give work to another student. It could be be turned in as 
their 
	work. The student that gives the work is as guilty as the student that 
takes the work. The University of South Carolina's Rule of Academic 
	Responsibility states: </p>
	<blockquote>It is the responsibility of every student at the University
 of South Carolina Columbia to adhere steadfastly to truthfulness and
	to avoid dishonesty, fraud, or deceit of any type in connection with 
any academic program. Any student who violates this rule or who 
knowingly 
	assists another to violate this rule shall be subject to discipline... </blockquote>

	<br><br>
	</p><p>As a student, member of the faculty or staff at the University 
of South Carolina you are a member of the Carolina Community and are 
	therefore obligated to adhere to the <a href="http://www.sa.sc.edu/creed/">Carolinian Creed.(http://www.sa.sc.edu/creed/index.htm) </a></p>

<section id="resources">
<h2>Responsible Use of Computer Resources </h2>
	<p>The University of South Carolina has a strong policy against 
computer abuse. Students are 
	expected to act responsibly using computers. This includes obeying all 
applicable laws regarding copyright and harassment. See the Student 
Guidelines 
	for Responsible Computing at <a href="http://www.uts.sc.edu/network/guidelines.shtml"> http://www.uts.sc.edu/Policies/Responsible.shtml. </a></p>
