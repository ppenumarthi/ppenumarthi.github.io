<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>Most applications utilize one dimensional arrays.  A few manage
two-dimensional matrices.  Fewer still manipulate three-dimensional
arrays.  And on a very rare occasion, an average C programmer comes
across the need for a four dimensional array (truthfully, I've been
doing this programming thing for over twenty years and I've yet to have
a practical need for one — I'm still waiting).  Well, waiting I am, and
I'm ready for them.  Not only am I ready for four-dimensional arrays,
but five-, six-, and beyond, courtesy of the following routine.
And they'll even be run-time dynamically-allocated multi-dimensional
arrays.</p>

<h3>Discussion</h3>

<p>Most languages treat arrays as static data structures; that is, their
size and dimensions are fixed at compile time.  C and C++ provide a
simple mechanism and notation to create dynamic arrays — ones that
can not only be sized at run-time, but resized as well.  Manipulating
dynamic multi-dimensional arrays, however, even in C, requires additional
work and expertise on the part of the programmer.  The programmer must
calculate the correct element offset from the beginning of the array in
order to reference the data properly.</p>

<p>The formula for determining the index offset for a two-dimensional array
is well defined and known by many programmers.  The formula:</p>

<p><code style="padding:30; font-style:italic;">row * number_of_columns + col</code>

</p><p>can easily be included in an algorithm to calculate the element offset
for a two-dimensional array, including one that is dynamically allocated
at run-time.</p>

<p>When you start to get into three-dimensional arrays and beyond, however,
the proper manipulation of indices and their offsets from the beginning
address of an array gets a little foggy for most programmers (including me).</p>

<p>The purpose of the following function is to allow the programmer a means
of referencing a multi-dimensional array using indices (rows, columns, etc),
without necessarily having to define the actual size of the array at
compile time.</p>

<p>Note that even though C only passes the address of an array to a function,
all dimensions of the array parameter (except for the number of rows) still
have to be defined at compile time in order to refer to the array inside
the function using index notation.  For example (note the 5 for the number
of columns):</p>

<p><code style="padding:30;">void test_function (int arrayIn[][5], int numRows);</code></p>

<p>The following function provides a means of still referencing an array
parameter using index-like notation even though the size (and even the
number of dimensions!) isn't known until the function is invoked.</p>

<p>The function <code>offset()</code> is designed to calculate the proper
offset location
of a specified index location, based on information passed to it about
the array; specifically, the number of dimensions, the number of elements
in each dimension, and the index location of the actual element needed.
It is written in a general way so it can handle any sized multi-dimensional
array, dynamically or statically allocated.  To simplify its use even
further, a wrapper for the function can be provided to hide some of the
gory details of the non-varying parameters for a specific array.</p>


<h3>Using the function <code>offset()</code></h3>

<p>The function <code>offset()</code> employs the variable parameter passing
techniques supported by C and its &lt;stdarg.h&gt; library of macros and
functions.</p>

<p>The first parameter is a pointer to an array of integers.  The first
value in this array (index[0]) indicates the number of dimensions that are
in the array to be processed.  The other elements in the array indicate the
number of elements in each of the dimensions indicated in the 0th element.
For example, to indicate a four dimensional array that has 2 rows,
3 columns, 4 levels, and 5 files, the array could be defined as follows:</p>

<p><code style="padding-left:30;">int arrayInfo[] = { 4, &nbsp;2,3,4,5 };</code></p>

<p>The subsequent parameters to <code>offset()</code> consist of the indices
of the actual element needed.  For example, to reference element
<code>[1][2][1][3]</code> in the array, the second through fifth parameters
passed to <code>offset()</code> would be 1, 2, 1, and 3, respectively.
A complete call to the function for this element position would be:</p>

<p><code style="padding-left:30;">offset (arrayInfo,1,2,1,3)</code></p>

<p>The function returns a long integer that indicates the typeless distance
from a 0 initial address.  It is the programmer's responsibility to add
this value to the address of the array.  This process can be simplified
by using a wrapper around <code>offset()</code>.</p>

<p>Several additional examples are shown below in the <code>main()</code>
function that demonstrate the use of <code>offset()</code>.</p>


<h3><code>offset()</code> function Wrappers</h3>

<p>Referencing the <code>offset()</code> function directly is still a little
cumbersome and not very intuitive in certain code situations.  A better interface
would be one that provides a simulated indexing notation, like a normal
reference to a multi-dimensional array.  A simple wrapper, through the
use of a <code>#define</code> statement, can be used to hide the details of using
<code>offset()</code> and performing the address calculation to access the actual
element in the array.  A separate wrapper would need to be defined for
each array that is to use <code>offset()</code>.

</p><p>Samples of these wrappers for two-, three-, four-, and five-dimensional
arrays, as well as a dynamic three-dimensional array, are shown in the
example program below.</p>


<h3>Error Checking</h3>

<p>Minimum error checking is included in the <code>offset()</code> function
in its present form.  It is the programmer's responsibility to define the
informational array for the first parameter, as well as pass the proper number
of parameters based on the information supplied in the information array.</p>

<p>Through a simple <code>assert()</code> call, <code>offset()</code> will
verify that the parameter indices are legally within the array bounds (upper
bounds only... I assume C programmers know they can't have negative indices).</p>

<p>I wish to thank Denis Conrady and Sean Wheeler for their initial
discussions with me concerning the concepts of what I was trying to
accomplish with this function.  I also would like to thank my wife Lisa
for deriving the actual formula that I ultimately translated into code.</p>
